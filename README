|| YET ANOTHER STEPPER|
||        DRIVER      |
#+--------------------+
This is a breakout board for the TI DRV88xx series.
I have designed it with the DRV8825 in mind although
it may work with other DRV88xx's. It's important to 
note that you can't actually do anything with this 
board as is, because all the control lines go to a 
flatflex connector which will attach to a breakout
for the Stellaris Launchpad that has yet to be designed.

The limit switch connecter is ment to connect to an 
optical interupt sensor, although i'm sure you can 
figure out how to hook it up to mechanical switches
if that is what you're looking for.

Make sure to check out the datasheet for the DRV88xx
you plan to use.

Important note:
This is only the 2nd PCB I have ever designed. I have
sook input from the forums at:
http://dangerousprototypes.com/forum/
That said, this has not been tested yet, so please take
it with a grain of salt.
